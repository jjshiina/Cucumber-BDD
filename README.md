### **Cucumber BDD API Framework Development from Scratch**
**Overview**

Welcome to the Cucumber BDD API Framework Development repository. This repository is part of my journey on learning REST API Automation testing by taking the "Rest API Testing (Automation) from Scratch-Rest Assured Java" Udemy course by Rahul Shetty. It contains a complete setup for building a Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) framework using Cucumber for API testing. The framework is designed to be robust, maintainable, and easy to use, providing a solid foundation for testing RESTful web services.
